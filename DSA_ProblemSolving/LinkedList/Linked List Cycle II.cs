    /// Leetcode Problem: Linked List Cycle II  
    /// - https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/
    ///
    /// Problem Statement:
    /// Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. 
    /// If there is no cycle, return null.
    ///
    /// There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again 
    /// by continuously following the next pointer.
    ///
    /// Approach (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare):
    /// - Step 1: Use two pointers, slow and fast.
    ///     - Move slow one step at a time.
    ///     - Move fast two steps at a time.
    ///     - If there is a cycle, they will eventually meet.
    /// - Step 2: Once a cycle is detected (slow == fast), reset one pointer to head.
    ///     - Move both pointers one step at a time.
    ///     - The point where they meet again is the start of the cycle.
    ///
    /// Key Insight:
    /// - Letâ€™s say the cycle starts at node `C` and the cycle length is `L`.
    /// - When slow and fast meet inside the cycle, moving one pointer from head and the other from the meeting point,
    ///   both will reach the cycle start in the same number of steps.
    ///
    /// Time Complexity: O(N)
    /// Space Complexity: O(1)
